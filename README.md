# PasswordGenerator

When button is clicked, password generator will prompt user to:
1) Ask if they want a randomly generated password.
2) Ask for the number of characters they want in the password.
3) Ask if they want special characters in the password.  
4) Ask if they want uppercase letters in their password.  
5)  Ask if they want lowercase letters in their password.  
6)  Generate a password tailored to their specifications.  

As you can see immediately, this assignment has not met some of the specifications of the
homework assignment.  I hope to turn in the full generator soon.  Sorry.
